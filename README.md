# Object-Prediction
# üõ∞Ô∏è Object Detection from Satellite Imagery

This project is a web-based AI application that uses the **YOLOv8** deep learning model to automatically detect multiple objects‚Äîsuch as bridges, windmills, ships, and vehicles‚Äîfrom high-resolution satellite images.

---

## üìå Project Objective

To automate the analysis of satellite imagery using deep learning and provide users with real-time object detection and visualization via a simple web interface.

---

## üß† Key Features

- Upload satellite images via browser
- Detect 20+ object categories using YOLOv8
- View annotated image with bounding boxes and labels
- Download detection results for offline use
- Simple and responsive frontend interface
